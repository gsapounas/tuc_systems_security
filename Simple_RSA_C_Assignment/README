/*This is a readme file to explain the implemetation of the given assignment.*/

In this assignment we were asked to develop a RSA encryption/decryption algorithm from scratch in C.

More specifically, this tool encrypts and decrypts the given files by the user.

To provide these functions, appropriate functions are designed and implemented.

-Read_from_file: This is a function that reads the given file and stores it to a buffer for further processing.
-Get_file_length: This is a function that calculates the file's data size so we can know how much size to allocate for the buffer that stores the data for further processing.
-Write_cipher_to_file: This is a function that writes the ciphertext to file.
-Write_plaintext_to_file: This is a function that writes the plaintext to file.
-Sieve of Eratosthenes: This is a function that generates a pool of prime numbers.
-GCD: This is a function that returns the Greatest Common Denominator of 2 numbers.
-Choose e: This is a function that chooses a prime number from the pool based on specific criteria.
-Mod Inverse: This is a function that calculates the modular inverse of 2 numbers.
-RSA keygen: This is a function that generates the RSA public and private keys.
-RSA encrypt: This is a function that encrypts an input file and dumps the ciphertext into an output file.
-RSA decrypt: This is a function that decrypts an input file and dumps the plaintext into an output file.
-Mod power: This is a function that calculates the mod exponentiation (a^b) mod n. This function was developed based on the Wikipedia page below.

To compile and run:

-Open a linux terminal in the project directory.
-Type "make" command.
-Run executable by copy/paste commands from commands.txt
-Enjoy!
