/*This is a readme file to explain the implemetation of the given
assignment.*/

In this assignment we were asked to develop a script that generates
input to exploit buffer overflow vulnerability.

The implementation is based on the fact that the Name array of the given program
is marked as executable with the mprotect. This means that the programmer introduced
an extra vulnerability in the program so it is easier to exploit this rather than
disabling ASLR and running the shellcode inside the stack.

Brief explanation how this exploit works:

1)Overflow buffer on the stack with InputGenerator output.
2)Program copies buffer into Name array (which is placed in executable segment of memory)
3)Jump into Name array starting address + 4 bytes (where noops are placed)
4)Shell code executes and gives us a user level shell.

In the beginning I run the Greeter program giving it a long string as
input, in order to find the right amount of character input allows me
to find and control the instruction pointer.

After finding the eip value and the buffer size, I introduced some no nops
in order to execute the shellcode even if the memory addresses change slightly.

At last, I introduced the shellcode that spawns a user level shell.

How to run:

1) Run input generator and feed generated input to program:
(python InputGenerator.py ; cat) | ./Greeter
OR by feeding exploit_input directly to program
(cat ./exploit_input; cat) | ./Greeter

Shellcode is a test program that spawns a user level shell, made for testing purposes.
