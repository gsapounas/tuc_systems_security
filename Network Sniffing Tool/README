/*This is a readme file to explain the implemetation of the given
assignment.*/

In this assignment we were asked to develop a simple packet capturing
tool in c using libpcap.

More specifically, the tool captures network traffic from given interface,
or it reads and analyzes a .pcap file.

To do that, pcap_open_live and pcap_open_offline were used.

In order to tell if a TCP packet is retransmitted, TCP packets were stored
in an array and each time the tool captures a new packet it checks if
the packet has been retransmitted with same ack number, seq number - 1 different 
than current ack number, different sequence number, less_or_equal payload size 
and fin or syn flags enabled or payload size > 0.

For UDP packets we can't tell at the transport layer if a packet has been 
retransmitted, because UDP is a connectionless protocol and retransmissions are 
handled at the application layer.
