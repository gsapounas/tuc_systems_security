/*This is a readme file to explain the implemetation of the given
assignment.*/

In this assignment we were asked to develop a simple firewall that blocks
ads using iptables.

More specifically, the tool gets as input domain names text file and resolves
each domain name to ip addresses. Then it makes rules based on these ip 
addresses and stores ip addresses to apropriate file.

Also it can make rules based on the ip addresses text file.

This tool can also save the rules to a file, load rules from file, list rules
and reset existing rules.

Answer to question 1:
This tool blocks ads by rejecting connection to the ad website. This means
that the ad site cannot be accessed. Some ads persist because they are placed
on the application level of the website (i.e. popup ads).
